1) WOD View Controller\
\
This is the main view controller for the WOD subnav screen. From here we can scroll through the RSS feed texts and also start the workout. This is where the user will be presented with numerous options for timers. The user can also post to comments, depending on which day is selected on the feed, to main site where everyone can see the results.\
\
2) Workout Detail View Controller\
\
This page is when the user descends down into a specific workout and requires deeper information on a particular workout. Movements that are used during the workout are listed and the user can specifically navigate to that movement to learn more about that movement.\
\
Users can also scroll side to side to view the next workout without ascending back up to the list view.}
